# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  user_name: amigo_one
  email: one@example.com
  # keep whatever other attributes you already had here
  # (only use attributes that actually exist as columns)

two:
  user_name: amigo_two
  email: two@example.com
  # keep the other attributes as well
